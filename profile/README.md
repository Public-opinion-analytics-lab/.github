## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About

The Public Opinion Analytics Lab (POAL) is a pioneering academic collaboration between the 
University of Reading (UoR), the London School of Economics (LSE), and the University of 
Southampton (SOTON), designed to advance the research, teaching, and practice of public opinion 
and political behaviour measurement and analysis. The lab is a collaborative, cross-institutional 
hub that attracts leading scholars and practitioners in public opinion research working to cultivate 
democratic resilience and accountability by supporting large-scale national election studies and 
comparative public opinion datasets, by rigorously testing and disseminating innovative methods 
of public opinion measurement, and by fostering a more informed, engaged electorate. Its focus 
will be truly global: we have experts on US, European, Latin American and African politics, as well 
as on UK politics. 

There are several unmet needs that this multi-University lab will address. First and foremost, while 
UK academia hosts world-leading public opinion researchers and survey methodologists, they are 
often isolated across di erent institutions, resulting in ine iciently duplicated research activities 
and limited collaboration. Secondly, the rise of AI represents a critical pressure point for survey 
research: building synergies to turbocharge methodological innovation is an immediate priority. 
Thirdly, the connection between public opinion scholars, political campaigns, the media, and the 
public is often weak, placing excessive strain on a few renowned academics who often must 
decline the numerous requests. Partiesâ€™ HQ and NGOs/advocacies, furthermore, often need 
flexible and short-term academic advice but do not know how to procure it quickly and efficiently. 
Fourthly, navigating polling and elections is often rife with misinformation for voters and political 
representatives, and, in addition, there is an unmet need for AI and computational skills in our 
current political behaviour teaching offer.

To address all these gaps, POAL has four overarching strategic goals: (1) empowering research 
excellence; (2) boosting methodological innovation; (3) fostering knowledge exchange with 
practitioners; (4) augmenting public engagement, as well as academic teaching, mentoring and 
training on public opinion and political behaviour. In the long run, we intend for the multi-University 
lab to also serve as a data center for hosting â€“ or providing methodological support to â€“ key 
European electoral surveys, and/or functioning as an in-house polling center, which could serve 
academics and practitioners, and support public dissemination and teaching and training e orts as 
well. The lab is chiefly intended as a framework for fostering synergies and facilitating academic 
dialogue. Any formal collaborations resulting from this, such as joint grant applications, events, or 
training, will follow standard institutional processes. 

## Research Excellence

Our core mission is to improve the quality of public opinion and political behaviour research through 
collaboration, innovation, and knowledge exchange between academic institutions, political 
stakeholders, and industry practitioners. To support this goal, we will institute the public opinion 
and survey methodology seminar series, by sharing slots on current departmental political 
behaviour seminar series in the three institutions in the first instance. We will also regularly work to 
submit sponsored panels or mini-conferences in leading academic conferences. We will institute 
regular writing/grant writing retreats (twice a year), and we will have a dedicated grant unit to work 
collaboratively with institutional research o ices in identifying public opinion and survey 
methodology funding calls and to encourage collaborative grant applications, as well as in 
identifying pots of funds in the partner institutions that can be used for workshops, research 
culture/collaboration or public engagement and training. Finally, we will work, in the long run, 
institute an academic blog (to be hosted in the labâ€™s o icial website), inviting submissions globally 
from leading public opinion and survey methodology experts. 

## Innovation

In addition to advancing academic research, the lab aims to test and accelerate methodological 
innovations in public opinion polling. Unobtrusive measurement of attitudes is entering a new, 
promising, era with AI. At the same time, AI poses important risks in attitude formation 
(disinformation, deep fakes) and for the quality of polls and the rigour of survey methodology. To 
support researchers on survey methodology, POAL will have its dedicated methodology unit, 
tasked with all training, impact and public engagement activities concerning polling methods, and 
devising activities to sharing best practices and provide methodological feedback to academic 
researchers. The unit will be responsible for POALâ€™s methods briefs and reports series, and for 
establishing links and advising/supporting big cross-national survey programmes (e.g. EES, 
Afrobarometer, CSES) on survey methodology. The unit will also work to establish a data centre and 
in-house polling capacity in the longer term. 

## Impact & Public Engagement

POAL strives to make a significant impact on the political and policy landscape by connecting 
academia with key stakeholders. We aim to support policy-making through evidence-based public 
opinion analysis, working closely with political advisers, think tanks, and media organizations to 
bridge the gap between academia and practice. Our consultancy services will o er both strategic 
insights and methodological expertise, empowering political campaigns and policy organizations 
to better understand and respond to public sentiment. We will institute a media unit and a 
contract/consultancy unit. These will be tasked with developing a media strategy or acting as a one
stop shop for media appearance and opinion pieces requests, and with negotiating partnerships 
with polling and political insights companies, as well as political party and NGO campaign and 
strategy units. The media unit will also be responsible for POALâ€™s â€˜public explainersâ€™ and public 
event series. The contract/consultancy unit will be also responsible for POALâ€™s â€˜Westminster 
seriesâ€™, where POAL members will deliver presentations on public opinion trends to legislators. 

## Teaching and training

POAL will be an important avenue for its members and early career researchers to learn from each 
other, mentor each other, and to gain methodological and industry skills. POAL will also actively 
engage in public education and awareness, developing teaching resources and training programs 
aimed at improving public understanding of polling, political data, and the implications of data
driven campaigns for democracy. The lab will support academic departments across the country 
with teaching resources and strategies on how to embed data science skills in their political 
behaviour and public opinion modules. It will also support the delivery of summer schools or 
executive programmes on political analytics.
